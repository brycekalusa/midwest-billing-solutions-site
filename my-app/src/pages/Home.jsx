              2020 revolutionized the workplace. For many, that meant trading in
              the typical office setting and creating a space in our homes. As
              the country continues to find balance in this newfound norm,
              Midwest Billing Solutions, LLC strives to embrace this change and
              help others benefit from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cost, efficiency, reliability, knowledge, accountability, patient
              satisfaction, drive, and passion are just a few of the factors
              that should be considered when searching for a quality billing
              company.
            </p>
            <p>
              We at Midwest Billing Solutions, LLC know this is not just a 9-5
              job. Our motto is “if you don’t get paid, we don’t either.” This
              means you can be sure that we will work harder to get your claims
              paid. No matter how many days per week, no matter how many hours
              per day - we work until the job is done.

                    This is perhaps the biggest benefit of outsourcing your
                    billing to a third-party company. Medical practices pay
                    thousands of dollars each year for employee wages, training,
                    benefits, paid time off, office equipment, and software. On
                    top of that is the high cost of a practice management
                    system, which can be anywhere from $80.00 - $800.00 per
                    month, and can sometimes be charged per registered user.
                    Outsourcing allows you to reduce or eliminate a lot of these
                    expenses.

                    The healthcare industry is ever-growing and changing; which
                    means that, although we are certified billers and coders
                    with over 12 years of experience, we may not always have the
                    answers. However, more important than having the answers is
                    knowing how to find them.

                    We utilize numerous, reputable resources to make sure we

                    provide our clients with relevant information regarding

                    Great patient care is arguably the most important factor in
                    running a successful practice. By outsourcing your billing
                    needs, the in-house staff can focus on patients rather than
                    billing claims, fixing denials, or sending appeals.

                    Making mistakes can be easy. Owning up to those mistakes is
                    what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary.
                    Providers need to have a sense of trust in those they place
                    in charge of their billing. Picking the wrong person could
                    cost you thousands of dollars.

                    We take this part of our job very seriously. Our company has
                    seen first hand what can happen if trust is placed in the
                    hands of someone who does not value your business. When you
                    contract with us, we want to give you back that trust, but
                    putting things back in order and showing not only pride in
                    the work we do, but also owing up to any mistakes made. Our
                    word is our bound and without it, we can’t call ourselves an
                    honest, trust-worthy business partner.

                    Administrative staff that is overwhelmed with juggling

                    Think about what got you into the medical industry in the
                    first place? Was it the wealth of knowledge you would obtain
                    to help others? Is it a passion and drive to succeed and
                    make a difference in the health of your patients? Finding
                    someone, be it a billing company or an individual who shares
                    those same core values can be difficult.
